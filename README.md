#Singly Linked List Reverse
#Tips 
In order to reverse the linked list:

`first iterate through the list and at each step we need to reverse the link like after first iteration head will point to null and next element will point to head. `

`At the end of traversal when you reach the tail of the linked list, the tail will point to the second last element and it will become a new head because you can now traverse through all elements from this node.`
